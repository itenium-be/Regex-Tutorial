# Itenium Blog

Check for doubled words in the the text.  
You know, like in the sentence above.

## Context

It has happened before you know it.

## Exercises

```sh
git clone https://github.com/itenium-be/blog-posts
```

ATTN: The regex should match one "the the" (NOT two!!)


TODO: Look into adding a spelling/grammer check to Jekyll instead?


### Blog Move

We decided that `https://itenium.be/blog/xxx` is not as cool
as `https://blog.itenium.be/xxx`.
Our intern worked on this for several hours but because
we have so many blog posts, he's still not halfway there.

Let's regex instead.

Our sitemap indicates we have the following urls:

```text
https://itenium.be/blog/article1
https://www.itenium.be/blog/article2
http://itenium.be/blog/category/article3
```

And we would move everything to:

```text
https://blog/itenium.be/article1
https://blog.itenium.be/article2
https://blog.itenium.be/category/article3
```


### Financial Articles

It has come to our attention that our financial articles on the blog
use all kinds of money formatting. We would like to have this uniform
on the entire site.

Desired format

```text
# Positive
€ 1 000.50

# Negative
€ 1 000.50-
```

The intern already did some research and thinks the following formats
are currently in use:

```text
EUR 1000
EUR 1000,-
€25,3
€12,000.5400000003
EUR -1000
-2500.5 EUR
```

Note that maybe we could write several "easy" regex to tackle the different
existing formats instead of one huge regex.


### Quotes

Sometimes a regular dash (`-`) is used to annotate the origin of the quote.
This is unacceptable. It should obviously be a long dash (`—`).

Note that we only want to do this for quotes (line starts with `>`)
and only for the origin. Do not replace a dash inside the quote itself!

### Package Versions

We have been keeping track of the versions of libraries, frameworks, languages etc
in our blog posts in the following format:

```yaml
package-versions:
  jest: 29.5.0

package-versions:
  vue: 2.6.6
  vue-router: 3.0.1
  vuex: 3.0.1
  vue-cli: 3.5.3
```

This information was not being displayed in the blog post however.
We now want to show the versions somewhere in the HTML.

Turns out that Liquid/Jekyll cannot do this...  
We need to turn the `package-versions` into this format instead:

```text
package-versions:
  - package: jest
    version: 29.5.0

package-versions:
  - package: vue
    version: 2.6.6
  - package: vue-router
    version: 3.0.1
  ...
```
