# Data Scraping

We received a huge file and we need to find something in it.


## Exercise 1

Get all `Messages` in the Category `ERROR`:

```log
Timestamp       Category  Message
1598843202      INFO      Booting up system
1598843402      INFO      Booting up critical service: Authorization
1598843502      INFO      System booted successfully: NO ERROR
1598853502      INFO      User admin requested access for userlist
1598863888      ERROR     User annonymous attempt to access protected resource without credentials
1598863891      INFO      System health check status: passed
1598863901      ERROR     Requested resource not found
1598864411      INFO      User admin logged out
1598864419      ERROR     This one is too common
1598864420      ERROR     Requested resource not found
```

What if we only wanted to find ERRORs in specific cases?

- Filter out some common errors we're not interested in
- Only find ERROR if the previous line was ALSO an ERROR line
- Only find each error message once (TODO: do you want to use regex for this?)


## Exercise 2

Typically some context is logged along the message.

We're interested in all ERRORs with `clientId: 15`.


```log
Timestamp    CONTEXT                Category  Message
1598843202   {client: {id: '15'}}   INFO      Booting up system
1598843402   {client: {id: '15'}}   INFO      Booting up critical service: Authorization
1598843502   {enterp: {id: '15'}}   INFO      System booted successfully: NO ERROR
1598853502   {client: {id: '15'}}   INFO      User admin requested access for userlist
1598863888   {client: {id: '15'}}   ERROR     User annonymous attempt to access protected resource without credentials
1598863891   {client: {id: '15'}}   INFO      System health check status: passed
1598863901   {client: {id:  15 }}   ERROR     Requested resource not found
1598864411   {client: {id: '15'}}   INFO      User admin logged out
1598864419   {enterp: {id: '15'}}   ERROR     This one is too common
1598864420   {client: {id: '13'}}   ERROR     Requested resource not found
```
