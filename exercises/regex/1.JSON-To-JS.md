# JSON to JS

Or, you know, the other way around...

## Context

While you can just use JSON directly into JS,
there might be an eslint or prettier configuration
that disagrees with merely importing json into js.


## Exercise 1

There are a lot of cases here, find a balance between a "full regex solution"
and a "good enough regex solution with some multi cursor witchery".

Hint: a full blown regex solution is not that hard here.


```json
{
  "_id": 15,
  "active": true,
  "name" : "Wilkinson - Bins",
  "email": {
    "to": "Wilkinson-Bins_Ritchie@gmail.com",
    "subject" :"New Invoice",
    "attachments": ["pdf", "Getekende timesheet"]
  }
}
```

### Expected Result

```js
{
  _id: 15,
  active: true,
  name: "Wilkinson - Bins",
  email: {
    to: "Wilkinson-Bins_Ritchie@gmail.com",
    subject: "New Invoice",
    attachments: ["pdf", "Getekende timesheet"]
  }
}
```

### Solution Steven:

Regex:
\"(.*)\"\s*(?=\:)

Replace:
$1

## Exercise 2

Oh noes, we need to convert it to Yaml instead!?

```yaml
  _id: 15
  active: true
  name: "Wilkinson - Bins"
  email:
    to: "Wilkinson-Bins_Ritchie@gmail.com"
    subject: "New Invoice"
    attachments: ["pdf", "Getekende timesheet"]
```
