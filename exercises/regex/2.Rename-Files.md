# File renaming

## Context

From some completely legitimate source, we've got
a bunch of files. We want to rename them but after
maually updating this for the first seasons, I thought,
"Maybe there is a better way".


## Exercise 1

File names to be cleaned:

```
Uncle from Another World S01E01 480p x264-mSD[eztv].avi
Uncle.from.Another.World.S01E02.480p.x264-mSD[eztv.re].mkv
Uncle.from.Another.World.S01E03.1080p.NF.WEB-DL.USAC2.0.AV1-PiroRips.mkv
Uncle from Another World S01E04 720p WEB h264-QUiNTESSENCE[eztv]
```

The cleaned up names look like this:

```
Uncle from Another World - Season 1 Episode 01.avi
Uncle from Another World - Season 1 Episode 02.mkv
```


TODO: Look into using PowerToys instead?



## Exercise 2

Looks like some subtitles came with the other files, or something.

- Remove advertisements
- Remove Html
- Remove hearing impaired


```srt

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,074
