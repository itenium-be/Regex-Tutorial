# Data Scraping

## Context

We copied a table from somewhere and want to display it somewhere else.

That somewhere else expects Markdown however.

It accepts simple html like `<code>` and `<i>` etc but not `<table>`.

## The Table

```html
<table class="wikitable">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Metacharacter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>^</code></th>
      <td>
        Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it
        matches the starting position of any line.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>.</code></th>
      <td>
        Matches any single character (many applications exclude
        <a href="/wiki/Newline" title="Newline">newlines</a>, and exactly which
        characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and
        platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character
        is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character
        matches a literal dot. For example, <code>a.c</code> matches "abc",
        etc., but <code>[a.c]</code> matches only "a", ".", or "c".
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>[&nbsp;]</code></th>
      <td>
        A bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained
        within the brackets. For example, <code>[abc]</code> matches "a", "b",
        or "c". <code>[a-z]</code> specifies a range which matches any lowercase
        letter from "a" to "z". These forms can be mixed:
        <code>[abcx-z]</code> matches "a", "b", "c", "x", "y", or "z", as does
        <code>[a-cx-z]</code>.
        <p>
          The <code>-</code> character is treated as a literal character if it
          is the last or the first (after the <code>^</code>, if present)
          character within the brackets: <code>[abc-]</code>,
          <code>[-abc]</code>. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The
          <code>]</code> character can be included in a bracket expression if it
          is the first (after the <code>^</code>) character:
          <code>[]abc]</code>.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>[^&nbsp;]</code></th>
      <td>
        Matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets.
        For example, <code>[^abc]</code> matches any character other than "a",
        "b", or "c". <code>[^a-z]</code> matches any single character that is
        not a lowercase letter from "a" to "z". Likewise, literal characters and
        ranges can be mixed.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>$</code></th>
      <td>
        Matches the ending position of the string or the position just before a
        string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending
        position of any line.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>( )</code></th>
      <td>
        Defines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the
        parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry,
        <code>\<i>n</i></code
        >). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group.
        <b
          >BRE mode requires
          <span class="nowrap"><code>\(&nbsp;\)</code></span></b
        >.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th>
        <code>\<i>n</i></code>
      </th>
      <td>
        Matches what the <i>n</i>th marked subexpression matched, where
        <i>n</i> is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in
        the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine
        capturing groups. Also known as a backreference.
        <b>backreferences are only supported in BRE mode</b>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th><code>*</code></th>
      <td>
        Matches the preceding element zero or more times. For example,
        <code>ab*c</code> matches "ac", "abc", "abbbc", etc.
        <code>[xyz]*</code> matches "", "x", "y", "z", "zx", "zyx", "xyzzy", and
        so on. <code>(ab)*</code> matches "", "ab", "abab", "ababab", and so on.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <th>
        <span class="nowrap"><code>{<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>}</code></span>
      </th>
      <td>
        Matches the preceding element at least <i>m</i> and not more than
        <i>n</i> times. For example, <code>a{3,5}</code> matches only "aaa",
        "aaaa", and "aaaaa". This is not found in a few older instances of
        regexes.
        <b
          >BRE mode requires
          <code><span class="nowrap">\{<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>\</span>}</code></b
        >.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

# Exercise 1

A markdown table looks like this:

```
| Metacharacter  | Description |
|------------------------------|
| ^              | Matches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.
```


TODO: If we have something complex and/or have to do this often, maybe look into using a Html parser instead?


# Exercise 2

Markdown what!? Can't we just turn this into a CSV so I can import it in Excel instead?  
But of course you can...

TODO: Excel has this capability built-in.
