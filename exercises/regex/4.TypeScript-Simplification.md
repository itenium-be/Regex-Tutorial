# TypeScript Simplication

## Context

While Typings are so very useful etc, there
is little use in defining the type twice...

These two are equivalent
```ts
active = true;
active: boolean = true;
```

Since `active = true` is less code,
we want to change this everywhere..


## Exercise 1

Create the Search & Replace regex to fix these
two inputs. (and imagine there are 2000 of them
instead of just these two;)

```ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component',
  templateUrl: './component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  @Input() active: boolean = true;
  @Input() redirectAfter :boolean =	false;
}
```



## Exercise 2

Because our TechLead is a very fickle person,
he also wanted to make some additional formatting changes.


```ts
// Our imports currently look like this:
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// But we now prefer:
import {Component, Input} from '@angular/core';
import React, {useState} from 'react';
```


TODO: Maybe later, look into not using regex but instead:
- https://github.com/codemod-js/codemod
- https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift

These tools typically only work when your working directory is clean.
I suggest you also always have a clean working directory before
unleashing a regex replace on a multide of files.



## Exercise 3

We noticed that from time to time `==` and `!=` is used.
We want to be more type safe and want to turn this into `===` and `!==`.

```ts
const result = val == val2;
const otherR = val!=val2
```



## Exercise 4

One of our colleagues (he who shall not be named),
has been hard coding our Department ID `159753.02`.

Looks like it's present in a few hundred files already.

```ts
if (deparmentId == '159753.02') {}
if (departmentId === 159753.02) {}
const ourDepartment = +159_753.02
```
