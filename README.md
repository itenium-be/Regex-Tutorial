## Visual Studio Code

### How to regex

- `CTRL + F`: Find stuff
- `CTRL + H`: Replace stuff
- `CTRL + SHIFT + H`: Replace stuff in multiple files

Once in "search mode":
- `ALT + R`: **Activate Regex** -- This is obviously crucial ðŸ˜‰
- `ALT + C`: Case sensitive/insensitive -- Useful in certain cases


### Multicursor

Regex and multicursors, a match made in heaven.

- `CTRL + D`: Select next
- `CTRL + F2`: Select all
- `CTRL + U`: Deselect current
- `CTRL + K, D`: Deselect current & select next
- `CTRL + ALT + UP/DW`: Insert extra cursor
- `SHIFT + ALT + i`: Turn selection into cursors
- `SHIFT + ALT + LEFT/RIGHT`: Shrink/expand selection
- `CTRL + Click`: Select word / insert cursor
- `SHIFT + ALT + drag mouse`: Select box


## Exercises

If a certain exercise doesn't seem all that handy for you, skip it!


REMEMBER: Maybe you don't need to write the perfect regex!

- Write one that is good enough --> Visual Studio Code will tell you how many matches
- When you get it down to an acceptable amount, maybe it's time to just cycle through them


Many exercises have a `TODO`: Maybe regex is not the best match for this?
Maybe there is a better tool when you find yourself doing this often
and have to tweak your regex just a little bit every time?
